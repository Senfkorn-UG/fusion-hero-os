"""Public/private data boundary — the ``VaultResolver``.

The public repository (``95guknow/fusion-hero-os``) contains **only**
interfaces, opaque subject identifiers, schemas and synthetic test fixtures.
Real personal data lives exclusively in the private vault repository
(``95guknow/fusion-hero-vault``) and is reached only through a
:class:`VaultResolver` implementation configured out-of-band.

Guarantees
----------
* **Fail closed** — if no vault is configured or authorisation is missing, a
  resolver raises :class:`VaultUnavailableError`/:class:`VaultAuthorizationError`
  rather than returning data or a fabricated default.
* **Opaqueness** — callers pass opaque ``subject_id`` strings; they never carry
  names, emails, device identifiers, MagicDNS names, etc. The graph and audit
  log store only these opaque ids.
* **No leakage** — resolved private attributes are returned to the caller for
  transient use only. Callers MUST NOT write them into graph snapshots or logs;
  the graph layer stores opaque ids and hashes, never raw vault values.
